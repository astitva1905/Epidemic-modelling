# Epidemic-modelling
A team research project on modelling epidemics using cellular automata. 
A complete project report along with thoeretical basis, working code, simulation examples, simulation analysis can be found in the repo.

## Personal Contirbution
I worked on the backend to manage the cellular automata and evolution across timesteps.
