# Epidemic-modelling
This Repository has 2 parts:
## 1. [Epidemic modeling using networks](https://github.com/astitva1905/Epidemic-modelling/blob/main/CompartmentalModelReport.pdf)
An individual project under the guidance of Prof. Toby Joseph to try and model epidemics using a novel compartmental model. I worked with Toby sir to develop the equations of the compartmental model. My personal contribution was designing and writing the code for a network based epidemic simulation, so that the compartmental model can be tested against it.

## 2. [Epidemic modeling using cellular automata](https://github.com/astitva1905/Epidemic-modelling/blob/main/Project%20Report%20-%20Modeling%20Epidemics%20Using%20Networks%20(1).pdf)
A team project that aims to understand epidemics better using cellular automata.
A complete project report along with thoeretical basis, working code, simulation examples, simulation analysis can be found in the repo. I worked on the backend code for simulating the cellular automata and managing the evolution across timesteps based on the theory using Python.
