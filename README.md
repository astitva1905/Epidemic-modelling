# Epidemic-modelling
This Repository has 2 parts:
## 1. Epidemic modeling using cellular automata
A team project that aims to understand epidemics better using cellular automata.
A complete project report along with thoeretical basis, working code, simulation examples, simulation analysis can be found in the repo. I worked on the backend code for simulating the cellular automata and managing the evolution across timesteps based on the theory using Python.

## 2. Epidemic modeling using networks 
An individual project under the guidance of Prof. Toby Joseph to try and model epidemics using a novel compartmental model. I worked with Toby sir to develop the equations of the compartmental model. My personal contribution was designing and writing the code for a network based epidemic simulation, so that the compartmental model can be tested against it.
