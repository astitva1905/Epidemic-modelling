# Epidemic-modelling
A team research project on modelling epidemics using cellular automata. 
A complete project report along with thoeretical basis, working code, simulation examples, simulation analysis can be found in the repo.

## Personal Contirbution
I worked on the backend code for simulating the cellular automata and managing the evolution across timesteps based on the theory.
